    4. HTML Structure

HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships. As you saw in the last exercise, we placed <p> tags within <body> tags. When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element. The child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element.
In this example, the <body> element is the parent of the <div> element. Both the <h1> and <p> elements are children of the <div> element. Because the <h1> and <p> elements are at the same level, they are considered siblings and are both grandchildren of the <body> element.
Understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements can inherit behavior and styling from their parent element. Youâ€™ll learn more about webpage hierarchy when you start digging into CSS.

Instructions

1. Add the paragraph below as a child of the div element.

<body>

  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <div>
    <p>This paragraph is a child of the div element and a grandchild of the body element </p>
  </div>
