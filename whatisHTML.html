<strong>1. What is HTML?</strong>
HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos. Right-click on any page on the internet, choose “Inspect,” and you’ll see HTML in a panel of your screen. 
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:
    • A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. 
    • In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements. 
    • HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks. You probably clicked on a couple of hyperlinks on your way to this Codecademy course.
